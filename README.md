An Angular Project offering managed solution for audio-video teaching systems. It can be installed in school classrooms or presented in seminars. It provides a content management console and generates statistics over the usage.
The Project is designed for remotely located institutions with no access to the internet. Videos files can be directly embedded in the application. However, the code can be tweaked here and there to make it ready for internet accessing institutions (all necessary code is commented in files).
It is an in-browser solution with the file system of the operating system as the base for data storage (JSON Files).Express.js, a minimalist web framework for Node.js is used for Backend to host the project on the server.
The project follows the guidelines of Progressive Web Apps.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
